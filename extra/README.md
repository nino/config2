# What is this folder all about?

I like to try new text editors, and macOS doesn't make it super easy to specify
a program to open all plain-text files. So I made this folder with empty files
with all the plain-text file extensions I expect to need to open. Now I can
select all the files, press Cmd-Option-i, select an app to open all the files,
and then click "Change All…".

the inspector is visible on the side. The "Open With:" dropdown and "Change
All…" button are highlighted with a red box.](./screenshot.png)
